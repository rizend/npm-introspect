# Introspect

Introspect is a tool for visualizing the quality and condition of packages in your project.

Install Introspect globally and run it from the command line to launch a rich visualization of packages used in your project. Introspect will provide scores from [npms.io](https://npms.io/) for each package's quality, maintenance, and popularity. These include standardized scores like commit frequency and tests, and aggregates like number of dependents. Introspect combines Github statistics, vulnerabilities and outdated dependencies, package descriptions, and builds graphs of each packages' dependencies.

The [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) registry contains more than double the packages of the next most populated package manager. Npm has and has 500 thousand packages and nearly 400 million downloads a day at the time of this writing.

Credible scores for npm packages help the Javascript community converge on quality packages to maintain. Introspect, powered by [npms.io](https://npms.io/) allows you to examine the packages you are using and explore the rich graph of npm's packages.

```bash
introspect -l

```bash
