# npm-introspect

Introspect is a command line tool to examine and visualize package quality. 

//

### The Problem

Have you ever searched for a library in npm and found 30 different, uniquely inadequate options?

[Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) contains more than double the amount of packages of the next most populated package manager. It is a victim of its own success. Npm too often is a market of imperfect information, poor packages can be gitStarlets and common developer problems can lack a clear leader- creating an ecosystem with uniform incomplete solutions. 

Enter [npms.io](https://github.com/npms-io/npms-analyzer).

Npms.io is an effort to score npm packages so that the community can converge around quality code. 

Promote a transparent and more functional open source ecosystem. Use npm-introspect and [npms.io](https://npms.io/)

### Installation 

```bash
npm i npm-introspect -g 
```






```bash
introspect react redux kefir -p 5000
```




Install npm-introspect globally and run it from the command line to launch a rich visualization of packages used in your project. Introspect will provide scores from [npms.io](https://npms.io/) for each package's quality, maintenance, and popularity. These include standardized scores like commit frequency and tests, and aggregates like number of dependents. Introspect combines Github statistics, vulnerabilities and outdated dependencies, package descriptions, and builds graphs of each packages' dependencies.

 Npm has and has 500 thousand packages and nearly 400 million downloads a day at the time of this writing.

Credible scores for npm packages help the Javascript community converge on quality packages to maintain. Introspect, powered by [npms.io](https://npms.io/) allows you to examine the packages you are using and explore the rich graph of npm's packages.

```bash
introspect -l
```
